Recently there have been many exciting works like AlphaGO by DeepMind and learning to play Hide and Seek by OpenAI. The game environment provides many complex scenarios to test several algorithms which can then be adapted to real-life important applications like autonomous driving and robotics.\nIn this article find my approach to let an AI agent learn to play Connect 4. Though simple for humans, large action space and several permutations and combinations of different board states prove to be challenging for an AI agent to learn to win. I used a Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to solve this problem and I am happy to share that I landed up in the top 30% among all the participants (my first Kaggle competition).\nAbout Connect 4 Connect 4 is a turn-based game where two players drop colored discs into a vertical grid alternatively. The aim of each player is to form a sequence of four discs in a row before its opponent. This is a perfect information game, meaning each player is well informed of all the events that have previously occurred.\nAlternatively, Connect 4 can also be considered as a zero-sum game meaning there is no mutual win or loss.\nKaggle environment to load ConnectX   Kaggle provides an amazingly easy to use OpenAI like gym environment for the Connect 4 game.\n  In order to final test your agent, you can also use predefined random and negamax agents.\n  Different Approach to solve the problem There can be many different algorithms to solve this problem like\n Minimax Minimax with alpha-beta pruning Q Learning Proximal Policy Algorithm Monte Carlo Tree Search and many more  I preferred using the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm because of its flexibility to solve games with large branching factors. The main bottleneck for games involving large action space (7 in case of connect4) is that requires it requires an extensive search considering the different permutation and combination of the given board. MCTS tries to overcome this problem in an efficient way as explained below by reducing the search space while at the same time maintaining efficiency.\nMonte Carlo Tree Search: Theory Idea: Monte Carlo Tree Search builds a search tree with n nodes with each node annotated with the win count and the visit count. Initially, the tree starts with a single root node and performs iterations as long as resources are not exhausted.\n Initial Setup — Start with a single root (parent) node and assign a large random UCB value to each non visited (child) nodes.  MCTS consists of four main steps\n Selection — In this phase, the agent starts at the root node, selects the most urgent node, apply the chosen actions, and continue till the terminal state is reached. To select the most urgent node upper confidence bound of the nodes is used. The node with the maximum UCB is used as the next node. The UCB process helps overcome exploration and exploitation dilemma. Also well known as a Multi-Armed bandit problem where the agent wants to maximize one’s gains while playing (Lifelong Learning).    Expansion — When UCB can no longer be applied to find the next node, the game tree is expanded further to include an unexplored child by appending all possible nodes from the leaf node\n  Simulation — Once expanded the algorithm selects the child node either randomly or with a policy until it reaches the final stage of the game\n  Backpropagation — When the agent reaches the final state of the game with a winner, all the traversed nodes are updated. The visit and win score for each node is updated.\n  The above steps are repeated for some iterations.\n Finally, the child of the root node with the highest number of visits is selected as the next action as more the number of visits higher is the UCB.  MCTS Summary  Each iteration starts at the root. Follows tree policy to reach a leaf node. Node N is added. Perform a random rollout. Value backpropagated up the tree.  Other common approaches Another common approach Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.\nIdea — If beta’s (minimizing player) maximum score becomes less than the minimum score of the maximizing player(alpha), the maximizing player is not required to consider other nodes.\nWorks well only when:\n A good heuristic value function is known The branching factor is modest.

However most of the captions convey limited information as the model used is trained on datasets that do not caption all possible objects existing in everyday life. Due to this lack of prior information most of the captions are biased to only a few objects present in the scene, hence limiting their usage in daily life. In this paper, we attempt to show the biased nature of the currently existing image captioning models and present a new image captioning dataset, Egoshots, consisting of 978 real life images with no captions. We further exploit the state of the art pre-trained image captioning and object recognition networks to annotate our images and show the limitations of existing works. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the quality of the generated captions, we propose a new image captioning metric, object based Semantic Fidelity (SF). Existing image captioning metrics can evaluate a caption only in the presence of their corresponding annotations; however, SF allows evaluating captions generated for images without annotations, making it highly useful for real life generated captions.","tags":["\"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\"","\"Computer Science - Machine Learning\""],"title":"Egoshots, an ego-vision life-logging dataset and semantic fidelity metric to evaluate diversity in image captioning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pranav Agarwal","Soumyajit Poddar","Anakhi Hazarika","Hafizur Rahaman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608546841,"objectID":"ef39e04fedc9dab646186340ce20c10a","permalink":"https://pranaval.github.io/publication/agarwal-learning-2019/","publishdate":"2020-12-21T10:34:01.628403Z","relpermalink":"/publication/agarwal-learning-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Cross-Modal biometric matching has been a scarcely explored field but carries several important applications and aims to further secure the currently existing security systems. In this paper, a framework for cross-modal biometric matching is presented, where faces of an individual are generated using his/her voice clips and further the synthesized faces are tested using a face classification network. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has become a recent trend in deep learning and has been widely used for image synthesis. We explore the advancements of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and generative networks for image synthesis. In the experiment, we compare the performance of Variational Autoencoders(VAE), Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks(C-GAN) and Regularized Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks(RC-GAN) and show that RC-GAN that is C-GAN with a regularization factor added to its loss is able to generate faces corresponding to the true identity of the voice clips with the best accuracy of 84.52% while VAE generates a less noise prone image with the highest PSNR of 28.276 decibels but with an accuracy of 72.61%.","tags":["\"Biometric matching\"","\"CNN\"","\"Convolutional Neural Network\"","\"Deep Learning\"","\"Generative Adversarial Network\"","\"RC-GAN\"","\"VAE\"","\"biometrics (access control)\"","\"convolutional neural nets\"","\"convolutional neural network\"","\"cross-modal biometric matching\"","\"deep learning\"","\"face classification network\"","\"face recognition\"","\"feature extraction\"","\"image classification\"","\"image matching\"","\"image synthesis\"","\"learning (artificial intelligence)\"","\"regularized conditional generative adversarial networks\"","\"speech recognition\"","\"variational autoencoders\"","\"voice clips\""],"title":"Learning to synthesize faces using voice clips for Cross-Modal biometric matching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pranav Agarwal","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
