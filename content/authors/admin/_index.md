I am a research intern at INRIA (RITS), supervised by <a href="https://team.inria.fr/rits/membres/raoul-de-charette/"> Dr. Raoul de CHARETTE </a>. Previously, I worked as a collaborator with <a href="https://nataliadiaz.github.io/">Prof. ‪Natalia Díaz-Rodríguez</a> (INRIA, Flowers). My research interest center around Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving and Robotic manipulation.

I completed my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Indian Instite of Information Technology, Guwahati, where I was awarded the President's Gold medal for being the overall topper. During the course, I was fortunate to work as a research intern under <a href="http://web.mit.edu/gemmar/www/">Prof. Gemma Roig</a> at Singapore University of Technology and Design.
